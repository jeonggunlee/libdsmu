This folder contains a simple Java socket server that accepts connections
on localhost:4444 (this can be changed in PrintServer.java).

To use this, you need both the jdk and jre (use sudo apt-get install default-jdk and default-jre to get good versions).

Then, setup is easy. From src/main/:
run "javac PrintServer.java PrintThread.java"

Then, from src/:
run "java main.PrintServer"
